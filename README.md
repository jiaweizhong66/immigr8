Interview coding project

Only the frontend is implemented due to lack of time.
Data is saved through local storage.

User can complete the form, when done click submit button will take them to Review Page, where they can further edit the form if they found errors in the form.

Form uses Yup Validation for the schema, however, the schema is not quite finished due to the lack of time to finish the project

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
